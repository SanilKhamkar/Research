# Research

Research is done based on a Design Paper.

Topic: Implementation of Geoserver and ArcGIS Server

The Implementation part proposes three methods:

1.	Webservices: Webservices include Web Map Service(WMS), Web Feature Service(WFS), FeatureLayer. Code is provided inform of Implementation for both servers.
2.	Testing Performance: For Testing purposes an application called JMeter is used to test the Throughput and Response time for both servers.
3.	Cost Criteria: Cost Analysis of both servers realted to License cost and Maintenance cost.

Repository has two branches excluding main:
1.	geoserver: Files include all the code used for implementation process
2.	arcgis: File includes all the code used for implementation process
